# Walking and crawling

The Character Controller, so the logic of the character's movement, especially, because it is supposed to be able to move on the wall and ceiling, turned out to become quite complicated. As well as learning Godot's Animation Workflow has taken time to figure out. 

So the after the first week I got to a point where I am happy with it. But it feels like tweeking and Bug-Fixing will never end.  

The next things to be made for Slime Boy is the elements, he can interact with and add them to his controls.

On the second week I was working on a [Team Whitespace](https://x.com/team_whitespace) Project which I also working on. More to that at some other point.
