# SlimeBoy is out!

First of I am sorry for not posting much these past weeks.

But just a week ago, I released SlimeBoy! I am really happy with how it turned out. It is just a short 10-20 minutes showcase of what Slimeboy can do in the environment I built for it. 

If you wanna play it, see it [here](https://thesongman.itch.io/slimeboy). Have a play, it is for free, and if you want to, you can support me as well.

For what to do in the coming time: I want to expand more on it. I will still evaluate wether I want to make more games with Slimeboy, but in some way I want to make him visit places. Be excited how I will continue with Slimeboy.

This is it for now and enjoy yourself!
