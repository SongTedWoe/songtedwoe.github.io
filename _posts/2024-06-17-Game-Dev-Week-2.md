# Slime boy is forming 

Last week I redesigned the character I previously created for an assignment for university, when I was in Ireland.

Art is not my strong suit, so it took a while for me to make the animation, but with most of it I was happy. More to come in that regard.

![Slime-Boy-Idle](/assets/images/2024-06-17/slime-boy-idle.gif) ![Slime-Boy-Walk](/assets/images/2024-06-17/slime-boy-walk.gif) ![Slime-Boy-Climb](/assets/images/2024-06-17/slime-boy-climb.gif) ![Slime-Boy-Land](/assets/images/2024-06-17/slime-boy-land.gif)

For the control of the character I built a state machine. So far I managed to let our slime walk, fall and idle. I was not quite sure, how I want it to traverse upwards - wether it can do only 1 step high climbs or climbs of variable height.  
But it will have been worth it to build it this way, since I am thinking to create more states and styles of movement for the slime. E.g. by eating up the things around it incorporates the object in its traversal skills.

I hope you will be able to enjoy our little slime boy soon. I will keep you updated.
