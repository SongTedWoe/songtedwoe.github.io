In this unreleased 2D Platformer you play Sumi that wakes up in a strange dimension and try to find your way out of it. Learn to change gravity's direction and manipulate your surroundings in order to get out of this world. 

As discribed is the main feature of this game, that you can change the direction of gravity. Together with [Tobias Moshammer](https://tobiasmoshammer.my.canva.site), we started working on this game early 2020. We did not finish this game, but were always keen to continue production of it. 

Tobias created the Art and initial Level Designs, I created the Code and Audio for it. I even tried my hands at creating a hard level, which was quite fun to do.
