In Core Bug you play as a Bug-Robot that wakes up in a broken down facility and finds a projectile that you can control midflight. But to do so you are going to need move as well. Will you find a way through the facilities contraptions to freedom?

The main idea in Core Bug is: Single Bullet Shooter where you can connect your own movement with the bullet. As a team, [Tobias Moshammer](https://tobiasmoshammer.my.canva.site) and I, created this Demo for a Pitching Competition. It started off as a [submission](https://teem.itch.io/bug-link) for the [GMTK game jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021), which featured the prompt "Joined Together", at that time called "Bug Link". We polished it and added a few more functionalities to get to Core Bug. 

There are ideas to change the concept of Core Bug to a different setting, but we did not get too far with it yet. 

For Core Bug I created the Code and Audio. Toby made the Art and Level Design for it. We used the game engine Unity for this project.
