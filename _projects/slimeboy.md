description: The first game I worked alone on. A Platformer without player controlled jumping. Slither your way around and up the wall and make use of different contraptions as Slime Boy, to get to the end of the trials.

In Slime Boy you control a sentient slime that researchers created and are now experimenting on. Climb up walls and use the different contraptions to navigate the tests designed for Slime Boy. Will you be able to be set free?

The main idea of Slime Boy is: How would a platformer without a jumping function look like? Slime Boy is the first Game I worked on myself, in several meanings of the sentence. It is the first game project, that I did in Uni. I just recently picked it up again and went through the process of making it a more fleshed out game. I created all the assets and code myself. From the art and animations to the Code and Systems and all the sounds and music. 

For the art I used Aseprite and in some cases other tools like GIMP (for the icon). The title screen was made by Aaronbae.

The Godot Game Engine was used to build the game. The code is written in GDScript, Godot's own programming language. 

For sound effects I heavily relied on [Chiptone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone), a chiptune sound generator. For music and mixing I used [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm).
